## Assessment Task
On this assessment you're going to be showing/hiding a button based on if the department is open or closed. The button is located on App.js, and you'll see I put OpenCloseLogic() already in App.js as well.
I've also done a console.log() and tested to see if the console.log() is printing properly. npm start is how you make this project go and it's of course on http://localhost:3000,


## Client Needs
We have a buy now button and a call for service button, we need the call for service button to go away when our Support department is closed. Also, when the button dissapears can you please make sure that the
border collapses down too? I've attached images for reference.

## Here are the Hours of Operation for the Support Department
Monday-Friday 7am-6pm MST | Saturday 7am-3pm MST | Sunday: CLOSED
